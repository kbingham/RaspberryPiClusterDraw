# RaspberryPiBoxCluster

This is the ultimate embedded multicore cluster project for raspberry pi.
Following on from the essential RaspberryPiBox project, this guide is updated
to highlight #ActualSteps taken by many global developers who assisted in the
inspriation of this project

## Parts (./configure)

To set up this project you first need to purchase a raspberry pi. Optionally
you can purchase extra units for this project to get your cluster going. This
project is now multi-arch capable, and can handle different board types; so
don't be afraid of which target you choose. MIPS/SH/x86 all work just as well.

## Setup (make)

This is actually a crucial part to this project. When your board(s) arrive,
open the box and admire the PCB. Show it to some of your friends, especially
outside of work. (They love that)

## Installation (make install)

Now that all of your friends have looked in awe at hardware, it's time to
install into the cluster by gently adding it to the drawer with your other
boards. Boards can be added to the cluster at any time, and will continue
to function in exactly the same way along side other cute embedded nonsense
